title: It Started With Lunch
---

One of the amazing things in the world is how easy it is to be part of a community - it just takes chatting with the people around you.  Earlier this week I met my friend [Ilias](http://www.iliasm.com/) for lunch to chat about podcasting...next thing you know I've found a new toy [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).  (more on that later)

For now I wanted to highlight some cool things that came out of a simple lunch meeting.

* Ilias wrote an [e-book](http://jekyllebook.com/) on setting up a Jekyll site using AWS tech (S3, Route53, and CloudWatch)
* The Dirty Shirly blonde ale from [Bushnell's Craft Brewing Company](http://bushnellcraft.com/) is yummy
* I was reminded how important community is to help keep your energy up

One of the dangers to a small startup like ours is that it is too easy to let your energy drop off.  Your day job is hectic, your home life is busy, and all you want to do is take a breath.  A couple of beers with Ilias was enough to reinvigorate me and give me the push I needed to get back to the keyboard and start bashing bugs so we can ship our game.

__The work you are putting into your business is to provide value to people - get out there and meet them it may be just what you need to feel accomplished.__
