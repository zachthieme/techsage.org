title: iOS 10 and WatchOS 3 - Day One 
---
Yesterday both iOS 10 and WatchOS 3 were announced at WWDC so I rushed home and installed both.   Historically, I usually wait till full release but in this case some of the new features in the Apple Watch made it worth the risk.

Compelling features 
* Faster response on watch apps 
* Handwriting recognition  

After the OTA install for both I was up and running.  My iPhone seemed to be working just fine the only challenge I had was my watch.  It didn't show a watch face.  No matter how hard I flicked my wrist - no watch face.  A bit of tweaking (basically configuring a watch face) and everything was back.

Initial Response:

**WatchOS 3**
* The apps that are set in the dock definitely respond fast.  Any other app still takes some time. 
* The handwriting is cool. 
* The more efficient text message replies is nice.
* Breathe app is interesting - not sure if i will use it

**iOS 10**
* I'm not sure if I like the look of the new notification page.  
* Accessing the camera via swiping is cool. 
* I'm interested to see the story on the new message app features. Is there a future where they will work on Android or other platforms?
* My phone got stuck in landscape mode (Had to reboot)
* Apps seem to die for no reason

Thanks,
Zach
